Welcome to the CS-370-X6161 Current/Emerging Trends in CS 23EW6 assignments repository. This repo contains code and documentation for assignments in the course taught by Professor Timothy Alexander, focusing on Week 5 to Week 7. Here's a quick overview of completed assignments:
##

## Week 5 Module 5

# 5-2 Project Milestone - Pirate Intelligent Agent
Designed an AI pirate agent to navigate pathways and obstacles in a treasure hunt game. Used deep Q-learning algorithm for agent training.

# 5-1 Assignment - Cartpole Problem
Solved the Cartpole problem using Q-learning algorithm. The challenge is balancing a pole on a moving cart, optimizing actions for cumulative reward.
##

## Week 6 Module 6

# 6-2 Assignment - Cartpole Revisited
Explored policy-based methods for Cartpole. Implemented REINFORCE and A2C algorithms. These directly optimize policy parameters for reward maximization.
##

## Week 7 Module 7

# 7-3 Project Two Submission - Pirate Intelligent Agent
Developed an intelligent agent for a treasure hunt game. Utilized deep Q-learning for agent training. Provided design defense to explain approach and algorithm evaluation.

In this course, I used reinforcement learning and neural network concepts in projects. The main project was creating an AI pirate agent for a treasure hunt game. To build the project, I used starter code and created deep Q-learning, REINFORCE, and A2C algorithms. The agent could navigate the maze, make informed decisions, and optimize pathfinding strategies.

I learned reinforcement learning and neural network architectures to train intelligent agents for dynamic environments in the course. The hands-on experience improved my skills in complex AI algorithms, neural network construction, and reinforcement learning agent performance tuning.

The skills I learned cover the entire field of computer science. Computer scientists develop and optimize systems to solve complex industry problems. Computer scientists shape society by creating intelligent agents, software, algorithms, and complex data.

As a computer scientist, I solve problems analytically. I design algorithms, break problems down, and use programming languages to solve them. My job requires technical skills, critical thinking, creativity, and adaptability. I value testing, iterating, and refining solutions to meet criteria and solve problems efficiently.

Ethics are crucial for computer scientists. In system development, I prioritize user and organizational well-being, safety, privacy, and security. Transparent algorithms and decision-making reduce bias. Awareness and risk mitigation are needed due to AI and technology's societal impacts.

This course taught me how to use reinforcement learning and neural networks. Creating a pirate intelligent agent and navigating complex algorithms showed me how computer scientists solve real-world problems. My ethical understanding, problem-solving skills, and ability to contribute to AI and computer science improved.
